# ispell-multi

(Future) MELPA-compliant packaging of Peter Helsin's
`ispell-multi.el`, basis of various `ispell`-related utilities.

**NOTE** This packaging is not yet complete. Do not use it unless you
want to suggest modifications.

When completed (or upgraded), this package will be proposed to MELPA,
its intended publicly-accessible repository.
